/**
 * This is the Block, the main block, the parent block of all blocks.
 * This component holds all of the functionalities needed for every block. For example. Every block
 * need to have the onDelete and onDuplicate functionality, for when we duplicate a block and for when we 
 * delete an existing block.
 * 
 * We also keep shared functionalities here like: when the user pastes an image on the text it should create
 * a new image block. Functions to create a new Block and to create a new content are also kept here.
 * Everything that is common for all of the blocks must be kept here.
 * 
 * @param {Object} block - The block object, this holds the object of each block. You can check `createNewBlock`
 * function inside of this component for details on the structure of this object.
 * @param {Object} blockCanContainBlocks - Object where every key is a block_type_id and every value is an Array
 * of block_type_ids. We use this so we can prevent the user from adding tables inside of tables. Basically. With this
 * every block that contains children blocks can filter what blocks it must accept as children. Like tables for example.
 * @param {Array<Object>} blockTypes - This is an array of rich_text.block_types. Remember `allowedBlockTypeIds`? we use 
 * that to filter out what block types must be accepted inside of a context. Also we use `blockCanContainBlocks` to filter
 * out what block types are accepted as children. This filters out not only the options of `BlockSelector` component but also
 * the block doesn't even render.
 * @param {Object} types - the types state, this types are usually the required data from this system to work. 
 * Types defines all of the field types, form types, format of numbers and dates and many other stuff 
 * @param {BigInteger} pageId - The id of the current page. A pageId only exists if this page was already saved, otherwise
 * this will be null.
 * @param {Function} addToolbar - Each block can define their own toolbar and customize the way they want. To keep this toolbar
 * in the top of the page on web and in the bottom of the page on mobile we use this function to send all of the parameters needed
 * to render the toolbar for this specific block. You can read more on `addToolbar` method in the RichText component.
 * @param {Object} draftMapHeap - When we duplicate a file, like an image or a attachment, whatever. We actually create a new reference for the same object (not literally)
 * So what this means is, when we upload a file we create a draft in our database, and when we duplicate this image or file we are creating
 * a new reference for the same draft that was created before. What happens is, drafts are temporary, so we need to reupload them again
 * if they still exist. So since the duplicated file is a reference to the original draft, when the draft is removed there is no way for the duplicated file or image
 * to know that the draft was removed. Except we actually save a reference of those changes.
 * @param {Function} onUploadFileToDraft - When the user is uploading a file we usually save a draft, a draft is a temporary file that will only be available
 * for a short period of time. * We use drafts because with them we do not need to upload everything at once, instead we upload them when the user actually
 * insert an image or a file. So when we save, everything will be already saved in the backend, we will not need to upload it
 * @param {Boolean} isEditable - As the name suggests, defines if the rich text can be edited or if it's in read only mode.
 * @param {String} activeBlock - The uuid of the block that is active at the current moment. Only one block can be active at a time.
 * with this we can display the toolbar for the current block or just focus on an input if it's active. This was first created
 * to be able to autofocus on an text input.
 * @param {Function} updateBlocks - We update everything by reference, we do not send ANYTHING to this function only the block that
 * you want to be active. More info can be found on `updateBlocks` function inside of the RichText block
 * @param {Function} setArrowNavigation - Updates the `arrowNavigation` state in the RichText block. Used for transversing between the blocks
 * using the arrow keys.
 * @param {Object} arrowNavigation - The arrowNavigation state from RichText block, check it for further details on the structure.
 * of the object.
 * @param {Array<Object>} contextBlocks - An containing all of the blocks of a context. A context here means that: on a table for example
 * we have a block inside of a block, so we will end up with 2 contexts: The context of the blocks of where the table is part of, and the 
 * context of the blocks inside of the table. THis can be used for transversing the blocks with arrow keys, handling on enter, on delete and 
 * so on. With this we do not mix with one another.
 * @param {Function} getAligmentTypeIdByName - Function that gets the aligment_type_id by a specific aligment name
 * @param {Function} getBlockTypeNameById - Function that returns a block_type name from a specific id
 * @param {Function} getBlockTypeIdByName - Function that returns a block_type_id from a specific block name
 * @param {Function} renderCustomContent - A function that recieves a content as parameter (see `rich_text_block_contents` in
 * `createNewPage()` function to get the structure expected.) And returns a Object with a `component` and `text` keys.
 * The `component` is the component that will be rendered in the middle of the text of a `text` block and `text` is
 * the text that will be inside of this component.
 * @param {Function} handleUnmanagedContent - This is an object where each key of the object is a character that should
 * be typed in the rich text in order to do something. `@` in some contexts might be to show a list of users, in others
 * it might be to show a list of fields. If `@` is being used, you can use `#`, '$', and other to open other options. 
 * The combinations are infinite. The value of each key is a callback function which recieves the X and Y position of the caret
 * in the window, on the browser. So we can display the options next to it.
 * @param {Function} onOpenUnmanagedContentSelector - This is a function to close the UnmanagedContent option when a text block
 * loses focus and such. This way we do not need to handle on the parent when a text loses focus.
 * @param {Boolean} isUnmanagedContentSelectorOpen - Checks if a selector of a custom content is open, so we prevent a text block
 * from being inactive, we can keep it activated inside of the rich text.
 * @param {Function} onChangeUnmanagedContentValue - We use this to change the unmanagedValue recieved by `unmanagedContentValue` props
 * back to null, after it had been used.
 * @param {String} unmanagedContentValue - We use this props to get the selected value all the way to the rich text. So we add this
 * value not to the actual text itself but to the `custom_value` property of the content.

     * Important: This has the same name as the addToolbar from the page component, so when a block is calling addToolbar
     * he is calling this function and not the function from the page component. 
     * 
     * THis is a function for adding the toolbar in the root of the page.
     * With this simple function we can maintain a simple API for the components to follow and also allow
     * complex layouts to be created.
     * 
     * So let's start. HOW THE Fâ€¢C* does this work?
     * - First things first: On the parent component we do not keep the state but instead we keep everything inside
     * of a ref. This way we can prevent rerendering stuff and just rerender when needed.
     * - Second of all you need to add this function on a useEffect hook or a componentDidUpdate, this way after every
     * rerender of your component we can keep track on what is changing and force the rerender of the hole page tree.
     * - Third but not least we save all of the data needed to render a Toolbar. This means we need the following parameters:
     *  - `blockUUID` - The uuid of the current block
     *  - `contentOptionComponent` - The React component of the content options we want to render, these are options of each content
     * of the block. They are usually the same, but sometimes you are not dealing with text, so you want to prevent the user
     * from selecting bold and so on.
     *  - `blockOptionComponent` - The React component of the BLOCK options we want to render, these are options for the specific
     * block you have selected.
     *  - `contentOptionProps` - The props that will go to `contentOptionComponent`
     *  - `blockOptionProps` - The props that will go to `blockOptionComponent`
     * 
     * HOW TO USE THIS:
     * You need to run this function ONLY inside of a useEffect of componentDidUpdate. MAKE SURE YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE
     * the state changes that you need. (for example, here we are listening for changes in props, every other state
     * change is irrelevant. When any of this states changes we want the toolbar to update accordingly.)
     * 
     * @param {Object} toolbarProps - OPTIONAL. The props you want to send to the toolbar. It can be undefined,
     * if its undefined we set a toolbar props ourselves so we send it to the richText, if it's not undefined we pass
     * the props on the tree until calling the richText component addToolbar
